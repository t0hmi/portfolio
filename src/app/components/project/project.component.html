            I recently developed a chat application as a side project, using Angular for the frontend and C# for the backend. I utilized WebSockets to enable real-time communication between the client and server, allowing for instant messaging between users.
            The application was designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with a sleek and modern interface. I implemented various features such as the ability to create and join chat rooms, send and receive messages.
